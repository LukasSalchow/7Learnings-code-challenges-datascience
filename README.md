## 7Learnings coding challenge

Note that due to time constraints I only did a very ruff analysis. The original task can be found here [general task description](https://github.com/7Learnings/code-challenges/tree/master/datascience) and [details](https://github.com/LukasSalchow/7Learnings-code-challenges-datascience/blob/main/Coding%20Challenge.ipynb).

## Some things left one due to time constrains

More data Cleaning:
- Scatter plots, time vs columns
- Outlier detection
- Statistical tests if columns have correct distribution

More Analysis:
- Plot temperature diagrams and compare them to known ones
- Look more at ppscore of time dependencies
- Find predictive patterns for snow
- Read climate science

Better Models:
- Try different models/different kernels
- Use an ensamble of the models that have performed the best
- Use a proper time series model e.g. ARIMA, recurrent neural network / LSTM
- Donâ€™t under sample to deal with imbalance rather try: 
    - Oversampling snow days
    - Data augmentation of snow days
    - Use all data with different metric e.g. a weighted one or F1 Metric
    - auroc (area under roc curve/likelihood of model distinguishing observations from two classes)

## Why are the outputs removed from the notebook?

My git is configured such that it automatically removes outputs from notebooks to avoid putting large generated data such as pictures into git repos.
